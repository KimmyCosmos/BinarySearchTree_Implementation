\# Binary Search Tree Implementation (C++)

This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++. The BST supports standard operations such as insertion, deletion, search, retrieval of the largest and smallest elements, and computing the height of a subtree rooted at a given value. The tree allows duplicate values using a count field in each node. The program provides preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals of the tree.

This project was completed as part of a data structures and algorithms course.

## Technologies
- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)

## Key concepts
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Recursive tree operations
- Pointer-based data structure management
- Dynamic memory management
- Traversal algorithms (preorder, inorder, postorder)

## How to compile and run

### Compile
```
g++ main.cpp BSTree.cpp Node.cpp -o bst_program
```

### Run
```
./bst_program
```

The program is menu-driven and allows interaction via console input.

## What I learned
- Designing and implementing a BST with duplicate count handling
- Writing recursive algorithms for insertion, deletion, search, and traversal
- Managing dynamic memory safely in a tree structure
- Implementing a menu-driven program for testing data structure operation
